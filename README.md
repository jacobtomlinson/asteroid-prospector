Asteroid Prospector
===================
A browser based game involving mining asteroids. Part of the [2014 NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/asteroid-prospector/).

This project is hosted via GitHub, therefore the game code is in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/asteroid-prospector/tree/gh-pages).

### Challenge
This project is a solution to the following challenge created by Dr. Phil Metzger.
>Develop a game to travel across the solar system going from asteroid to asteroid. The strategy is to decide which asteroid to visit and mine next, given a field of asteroids that vary in location, composition, size, and more. A major part of this challenge is learning over the course of the International Space Apps Weekend what the purpose and value of an asteroid resource utilization/industry could be and incorporating it into the game.

### Our Approach
One of the key things we wanted to achieve was to build something very basic quickly and get it published. Then we added lots of extra functionality in small pieces, always making sure the game was playable. Similar to agile development but we wanted to avoid using the word agile as we didn't want to get wrapped up in what "agile" is.

## The Game

### Story
It is the year 2128. The population of the Earth and Moon has stabilised at 11 billion through population control and environmental policies. There are no mineral resources left to mine. All other resources are recycled or sustainable. The Martian Colony is growing, but the resources of the planet are already under pressure.

The APE Mining Corp, the largest mining conglomerate in the solar system, is now opening up a new frontier - in the asteroid belt. A young Martian, you have just joined their operation as a freelance mining operative. The job involves spending months at a time in space, is sometimes dangerous and the company is a secretive, inscrutable bureaucracy, but you need the work...
